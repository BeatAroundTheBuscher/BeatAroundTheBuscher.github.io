## FAQ

Q: Why are there Elites in Omerta when I start the game?!

A: You enabled Enemy Generals and Omerta (A9) is one of the spawning spots

Q: The difficulty setting "Experienced" is too easy, but "Expert" is too hard?!

A: Try setting "Progress Speed of Item Choices" to "Slow". One of the reasons why Expert is hard is due to how well kitted out Deiranna's Elite Troops. Elites start at Cooldown 5 (of 10). "Slow" Progress Speed will reduce their coolness by 3 till you get to 10 progress, by 2 till 40 progress and finally by 1 till you get to 80 progress. 

Press "V" to see your current Max Progress (second number)
